## About Me

Hello! I'm a university student passionate about learning new thingsâ€”especially languages! I can speak:
- **English**
- **Korean**
- **Turkish**
- Some **Japanese**

My major is Sociology, though Iâ€™m not especially interested in it. Instead, Iâ€™m channeling my love for languages into learning programming from scratch. I don't have a favorite project yet, but I'm excited to start building and sharing my journey here on GitHub.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning

- I started an online class called Harvard's CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science.
- Exploring how technology can connect people across cultures and languages.

## ðŸ“š Goals

- Build my first coding project
- Collaborate with others and contribute to open-source
- Use my language skills to help make tech more accessible to everyone
